Known Bugs - Version 3

1. 	When completing a subCell victory that would send the next player to the cell that was just won, 
	everything is deactivated and no more cells can be clicked. This does not happen if a subCell is completed
	that would send a player to a large cell that has already been won. When this occurs, all available cells 
	become activated. Fixed
